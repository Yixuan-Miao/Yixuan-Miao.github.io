I am currently a graduate student at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee). Now working at [Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime). I am privileged to have the guidance and mentorship of [Dr. Do Anh Tuan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/qinc/about-qinc/our-team), [Mr. Sim Chan Kuen](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/qinc/about-qinc/our-team) and [Prof. Goh Wang Ling](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01105), doing cryo analog circuit design.

My research interests is quantum related cryo/low power TRx design. If you are interested in collaborating, please contact me. I'm open to any form of cooperation. ÔºàThis is just a quick summary of my academic focus, skills, experiences, and achievements, as well as a brief insight into my personality. For more detailed information, please refer to my Curriculum Vitae (CV), Research Proposal (RP), Personal Statement (PS), and Interview PowerPoint PresentationÔºâ

# üò∏ Life's Moments
- *2017.01.31* I completed my first [guitar and singing music video](ttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Js41187R2/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=2ea3adfcf37a4ce93c412a27398cad91) in my life, under the lens of my best friend Jiaming Zhang. Performing ["Beautiful Birds" by Passenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2RHLZQbZCU), a song from my most beloved idol. This video is truly precious to me because it is kind of like publishing a paper, haha.
