<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>



I am currently a graduate student at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee). Now working at [Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime). I am privileged to have the guidance and mentorship of [Prof. Goh Wang Ling](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01105) and [Do. Do Anh Tuan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/qinc/about-qinc/our-team), doing Analog\RF circuit design.

My research interests are TRx, analog and mm-wave circuit design. If you are interested in collaborating, please contact me. I'm open to any form of cooperation.

# üí¨ More about Me
I'm a soft-hearted person at my core. I cherish my family, my friends, and of course, myself. I'm in love with my life, this world, and everything in it. My passions include playing the guitar and traveling. My dream? To support each of my relatives as best as I can, enhancing their lives; To create a blissful family of my own, and, if fortune allows, to have a big dog, a bunch of kittens, and even a little garden where I can grow veggies to share with my loved ones. (Though in China, that's a bit of a stretch, so for now, I'm content with gardening in video games - ha!).


I find reading people fascinating and enjoy deep conversations, trying to understand the diverse ways people think. Consciousness, to me, is the most vibrant thing in the world. 


In my country, there's a phrase, [ÈõÖ‰øóÂÖ±Ëµè](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%9B%85%E4%BF%97%E5%85%B1%E8%B3%9E), which means appreciating both the refined and the popular. So, besides all this, to be honest, I also have a liking for money and beauty (luckily, my girlfriend doesn't get mad when I happen to scroll past a pretty girl in TikTok üòÑ). There's an old saying, "Greedy for wealth, fond of beauty, yet upright all life long." I believe that I am desiring wealth but being content, admiring beauty but knowing limits. Living uprightly, despising evil, and having compassion for all beings. That's me in a nutshell, I'm Yixuan Miao.

# üò∏ Life's Moments

- *2017.01.31* I completed my first [guitar and singing music video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Js41187R2/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=2ea3adfcf37a4ce93c412a27398cad91) in my life, under the lens of my best friend Jiaming Zhang. Performing ["Beautiful Birds" by Passenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2RHLZQbZCU), a song from my most beloved idol. I have a natural passion for music; I love singing and playing the guitar. However, I'm fully aware that my singing is not exactly gifted, so I embrace it merely as a hobby, like many others, and followed the path of education. What is life? Life is a game of time. In the blink of an eye, six years have passed. Sometimes I wonder if I can work hard enough to help my children resolve their financial issues early in life. Then, in a moment of reflection, ask themselves, "Who am I?"
