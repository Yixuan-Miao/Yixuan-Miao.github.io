I am currently a graduate student at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee). Now working at [Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime). I am privileged to have the guidance and mentorship of [Dr. Do Anh Tuan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/qinc/about-qinc/our-team) and [Prof. Goh Wang Ling](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01105), doing Cryo Analog circuit design.

My research interests is quantum related cryo TRx design. If you are interested in collaborating, please contact me. I'm open to any form of cooperation. （This is just a quick summary of my academic focus, skills, experiences, and achievements, as well as a brief insight into my personality. For more detailed information, please refer to my Curriculum Vitae (CV), Research Proposal (RP), Personal Statement (PS), and Interview PowerPoint Presentation）

# 💬 More about Me
I'm a soft-hearted person at my core. I cherish my family, my friends, and of course, myself. I'm in love with my life, this world, and everything in it. My passions include playing the guitar and traveling. My dream? To support each of my relatives as best as I can, enhancing their lives; To create a blissful family of my own, and, if fortune allows, to have a big dog, a bunch of kittens, and even a little garden where I can grow veggies to share with my loved ones (though in China, that's a bit of a stretch, so for now, I'm content with gardening in video games - ha!). 


I find reading people fascinating and enjoy deep conversations, trying to understand the diverse ways people think. Consciousness, to me, is the most vibrant thing in the world.

# 😸 Life's Moments
- *2017.01.31* I completed my first [guitar and singing music video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Js41187R2/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=2ea3adfcf37a4ce93c412a27398cad91) in my life, under the lens of my best friend Jiaming Zhang. Performing ["Beautiful Birds" by Passenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2RHLZQbZCU), a song from my most beloved idol. I have a natural passion for music; I love singing and playing the guitar. However, I'm fully aware that my singing is not exactly gifted, so I embrace it merely as a hobby, like many others, and followed the path of education. Even now, when I watch this video, I feel quite embarrassed; the singing is quite off-key and performed too shyly, completely unlike my usual self. But regardless, this video is truly precious to me. It represents a very important moment in my life. Life is a game of time. In the blink of an eye, six years have passed. Sometimes I wonder if I can work hard enough to help my children resolve their financial issues early in life.

- *2023.01.24* Me and part of my family spending the 2023 Spring Festival. (Thanks to my grandmother, who had five children including my mother, our family is quite large – nearly twenty people. Ha Ha.) Why are there only these few people here? LOL, the others might be busy playing mahjong, wrapping dumplings, setting off firecrackers, tossing dice, or endlessly adjudicating the never-ending disputes among the kids (kids' relationships are even more complicated than China-U.S. relations, 🤣). Interestingly, I am a person who is extremely unemotional. My actions are completely unaffected by emotions and are entirely rational. For me, emotions are something I can easily pick up and let go of, just as simple as lifting and setting down a kitten - I only experience the beautiful parts of love.
